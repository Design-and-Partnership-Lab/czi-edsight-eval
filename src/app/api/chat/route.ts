    Pair ${index + 1}:

    For each pair:
    1. Identify key similarities and differences
    2. Most importantly, provide an analysis that focuses on the educational insight or learning outcome both statements reflect

    For the analysis, think about:
    - What does this reveal about the student's learning process?
    - What pedagogical skills or growth are being observed?
    - What educational value or learning outcome is being highlighted?

    Write the analysis as one brief, insightful statement that emphasizes the educational significance. Examples, follow this format:
    - They were mostly similar: "You both agreed that the student demonstrated growth in their reflection skills."
    - They were mostly similar: "You both agreed that the student showed strong critical thinking abilities."
    - They were mostly different: "While the AI noted the student's analytical skills, you emphasized their creative problem-solving approach."
    - They were mostly different:"Where the AI commented on the studentâ€™s ability to use sources effectively, you noted room for improvement."
